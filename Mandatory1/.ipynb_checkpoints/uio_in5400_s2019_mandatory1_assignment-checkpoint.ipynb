The network will be densly connected, with an arbitrary number of layers, and number of nodes in each layer. We shall implement a ReLu activation function, and use a softmax activation in the last layer. The error will be measured with a cross-entropy loss function, and the cost will be minimized using a stochastic gradient descent optimization routine.\n",

    "You will be guided through the implementation step by step, and you can check your implementation at each step. Each subtask will be judged independently, so it should be possible to do one task even if you have not succeded in the previous.

In this task, we consider a simple convolution from a layer $x$ with shape $(M, C_x, H_x, W_x)$ to a layer $y$ with shape $(M, C_y, H_y, W_y)$ using a set of filters $w$ with shape $(N, C_w, H_w, W_w)$. More specifically, $x$ is convolved with $N$ 3D filters $w_j, j=1, \\ldots, N$, each with shape $(C_w, H_w, W_w)$. Channel $j$ in the output layer corresponding to example $i$ is computed as\n",

A convolutional layer is given the name because $(\\mathtt{*})$ is the 2D convolution operator, but to keep it simple, a 2D *correlation* is often used in stead, (which we will also do, although we will sometimes use the name convolution).\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be a lot of indices to keep track of, and this is why we chose to use the more \"programmatical\" notation with square brackets in stead of subscripts for indices. We use the `python` notation where $\\mathtt{a[:, :]}$ is the entire 2D matrix $a$.\n",
